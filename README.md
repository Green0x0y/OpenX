## Tree Task
This project contains two classes Tree and TreeNode which can be used to construct a tree data structure.
## TreeNode
The TreeNode class represents a node in a tree data structure. It has three fields: value, leftChild, and rightChild, which represent the value stored in the node and its left and right child nodes, respectively. The class also overrides the equals and hashCode methods to provide a custom implementation for comparing two TreeNode objects.
## Tree
The "Tree" class represents a tree with a root node of type "TreeNode". It provides two methods to compute the number of leaves in the tree and the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The class uses recursion to traverse the tree and calculate the results.
